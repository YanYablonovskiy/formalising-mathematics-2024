# Harder questions

Here are some harder questions. Don't feel like you have
to do them. We've seen enough techniques to be able to do
all of these, but the truth is that we've seen a ton of stuff
in this course already, so probably you're not on top of all of
it yet, and furthermore we have not seen
some techniques which will enable you to cut corners. If you
want to become a real Lean expert then see how many of these
you can do. I will go through them all in class,
so if you like you can try some of them and then watch me
solving them.

Good luck!
